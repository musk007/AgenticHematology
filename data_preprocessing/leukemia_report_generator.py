leukemia_report_generator.py
============================
Template-based hematology report generator that consumes the structured
`report_ready` block (and surrounding statistics) produced by an upstream
multi-image cell-detection + attribute-extraction pipeline, and emits a
short, fixed-format diagnostic report.

Design choices
--------------
1. Reports are generated from the *findings* (blast %, dominant cell type,
   diagnostic flags, blast morphology), NOT from the metadata diagnosis
   label. The label is treated as ground truth for QC only.
2. Routing is rule-based and deterministic so the output is reproducible
   and auditable (no stochastic LLM in the loop).
3. Supported impressions: ALL, AML (incl. AML with monocytic differentiation),
   APML, CML, CLL, and an "unclassified abnormal" fallback.
4. Each report section maps 1:1 to a section of the input JSON, so the
   structure can later be swapped for an LLM prompt template if desired.

Usage
-----
    python leukemia_report_generator.py cases.json
    python leukemia_report_generator.py cases.json --case-id 12
    python leukemia_report_generator.py cases.json --out reports/

The input JSON is expected to be either:
  (a) a dict keyed by case id, where each value contains the case payload
      shown in the examples, OR
  (b) a single case payload at the top level.
